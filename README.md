# Minesweeper

I made this game by using SFML.

To play the game, just open the Release folder and open SFML001.exe

To open the project in VS studio,there is only one thing you have to do.

Create a foldar called "External", pull out folders called "include" and "lib" from SFML-2.5.1.rar.
Then put those two folder into External.
